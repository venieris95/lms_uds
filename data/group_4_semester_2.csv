While I do not think I will ever take a sociology course ever again, this course was the best 101 course to take as an elective. The textbook I did find was unnecessary until the final assignment.",go to office hours and practice,"Really easy, the course was made up of 3 online quizzes (most of the questions were easily googlable) and the final project could be done in one day."
1,4005,Elizabeth Lozano,48,43,68,100,58,95,73,70,86,1,.,"One of my least favourite courses. Although things were nicely organized, Racket was such an annoying language to use. The one tangible benefit I felt after using Racket was feeling more comfortable with recursion.",Surprisingly useful and as bird as expected. I now casually plug in Freud into daily small talk
2,4013,Samantha White,64,66,81,78,39,90,71,80,81,1,"Took during Spring 2022. Classic introductory course, online with recorded lectures. Covers many different sociology concepts at a basic level. Assignments weren't too difficult, but probably very boring for people who don't like sociology.","It starts with a very low pace but after midterm, it gets really fast and I cannot understand the content while reaching the end of term. Racket is restricted by so many things so I feel I lose the freedom of coding. The assignments are extremely hard after midterm, I spent a whole day on them but I can just solve the easiest one. The only positive impression that I have is that the design recipe weighs half so I pass this course successfully.",Had this class online. The content is interesting but the modules plus textbook readings are long. 2 quizzes are due every other week but I wouldn't recommend trying to do 2 quizzes in one week unless you have the time to do so. Making notes can easily take up to 2 days even if you don't work on anything else. The quizzes need a lot of theoretical application which can be difficult especially trying to understand the star wars based questions. The article summary and concept map assignment are pretty easy but the rubrics are kind of vague. Overall the course is interesting but quite heavy in terms of workload.
3,4021,Diana Smith,41,42,54,98,23,94,72,80,90,7,Took this course with Prof Manji. Very good breakdown of marks/assignments so that you can do well.,"Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Started out pretty slow, but I didn't really pay attention and was severely behind. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well. After taking more cs courses, racket really is a weird language.","Took online. Really fun and interesting concepts, and course modules were organized well. Quizzes were very ctrl-F-able. Written assignments and infographic took longer if you wanted a good mark, but overall a good interesting bird course."

Assignments and lectures were straightforward.,"I loved everything about cs 115. Great instructors, fair assignments ( can get tricky but there's a huge amount of office hours to attend ), good engagement and interesting topics! It's seriously well structured and I would recommend it to anyone even with no background in coding.","Took the online version. Real interesting stuff if you actually read the weekly modules, but quizzes are totally control-F-able."
5,4027,Shawn Huffman,49,28,50,87,39,91,73,70,83,3,"Took this course with Ed and it was relatively easy. Theres weekly online quizzes but youre allowed unlimited tries to get 100%, one major group assignment that's spread out throughout the term, and one major paper at the end of the course. There is a textbook and I recommend getting it as well as going to class (although its not the end of the world if you miss a few classes since he uploads recorded lectures to learn)","I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid.","Not super fond of the course but some information is really interesting. The key to performing well is doing the lectures and readings, and keeping track of your quizzes."
6,4030,Ashley Lang DDS,83,53,45,72,76,93,72,91,87,1,"I took this course with the hope that it would be a light and fairly easy course to manage, and I was unfortunately wrong. The lecture material was more time consuming than expected because the prof wants you to do the readings and take notes, watch her lecture video, and then watch/listen to additional videos/podcasts that she links. The midterm and final (35% each) had some multiple choice, with a focus on short answer questions that could be fairly vague in my opinion. The assignment (30%) also had pretty vague instructions, and the TA's seemed to refuse to give anything above a 90% even if it was perfect. I wouldn't recommend taking this course if you're hoping it will be an easy mark booster, but its not bad.","I really enjoyed this course online, being co-taught by 4 professors. There were lots of office hours available to help and all of the TA's and Profs in office hours were helpful and kind. While the programming language used is not useful elsewhere, I think it is easy to understand and helped get the point of the course across. In my opinion, the point of this course is to teach you to think about solving problems and the process to go through, as you are not creating ground-breaking programs. As a student with no prior programming experience, I found this course both useful and easy if you kept up with the content and got help as soon as you needed it. The course was organized well, and the built in questions made sure you were on the right track. The assignments are fair based on what you learn. Go in with an open mind and keep up with the content and you should be just fine.",Heavy on readings but some of the readings and modules are pretty engaging.
7,4031,Laura James,65,61,38,77,17,87,78,69,90,8,"Not as birdy as I thought it would be, but pretty low maintenance course. Did not like the spread of marks this term (1 midterm, 1 final, 1 written assignment). For a class about sociology, it was a pretty anti-social class, barely interacted with the TAs, prof and students. Really enjoyed the content, as the subject is something really interesting to me. Textbook did the best job teaching cause the TAs gave very vague and minimal feedback.","math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself",Pretty interesting course but requires a lot of application-based knowledge that is not sufficiently provided in course materials
8,4035,Theresa Reeves,83,48,48,74,40,88,72,82,87,9,Easiest course I have taken in uni so far. I took it online in Fall 2021. The content was pretty straightforward. Anyone can easily get an 85+,"The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. This is a mistake I made when we had to work with modules. As long as u properly manage ur time and do assignments and concept checks well before the due date, you will have a great time in this course. Also try finding connections between assignments and try finding some real world applications of racket. Trust me Racket is very useful. The only criticism I have of this course is how the course is taught because it wasn't taught. (this is when I did online.) I had to understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts. Although There was plenty of opportunity like office hours to ask for help, I only realized that towards the end of the term. Very unfortunate :(","Tested material was mainly focused on textbook content which wasn't taught in lectures, but ended up doing fairly well in the course"

Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. TAs and ISAs are very helpful.","Very science-based. 4 tests, each worth 10% and a final of 60%. With sona only being 2%. Ridiculous."
10,4041,Annette Hunter,62,72,39,88,40,100,68,64,82,9,Good class. No complaints. Did well. Assignments were straightforward.,"This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions and I got yelled during office hrs even though I stated that I need a little patience (I am disabled). Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. I took to take this for bioinformatics option and decided to change my future career. Truly the worst in UW history. If you don't need this course, run.","Took this course online with Jennifer Stolz. Course was mostly quizzes. As long as you study the textbook, you'll do great."
11,4044,Samuel Wallace,62,52,44,94,25,96,75,60,93,8,"Pretty easy course, took online in Fall 21. Attending the weekly online lecture was optional, as recordings were posted the same day. Dr. Williams was very clear and the assignments/tutorial assignments were straightforward. Very harsh late penalty compared to other first year courses.","Not a bird course, although if you have background in programming it would not be difficult at all. Racket is somewhat useless but I learned some concepts that will be useful for other programming languages",Extremely easy if taken online
12,4047,Wendy Smith,40,30,46,92,36,81,82,60,86,1,"Boring class that I don't remember anything from. Prof seemed cool. If you're into sports, you'll like him. Have to buy textbook new each year, but it's nice to have all the readings in one little booklet.","I took this course online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so my review is based on a remote, online learning experience. Overall, as someone who is not a CS student and who doesn't have a lot of background experience and knowledge in programming, it's a great introductory course to the language of Racket and the overall concepts that will be useful in later computer science courses. The Racket language itself is not a very ""useful"" language that you may or may not use in later CS courses and even in a job, but the foundation it provides is very valuable and will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end. I recommend starting the assignments as early as possible and attend as many office hours if you have any questions. The course staff are very responsive and do offer a good amount of help depending on your questions. Overall, I can't say much about the in-person learning experience, but this course was suited well for online learning and I enjoyed it.",Online offering is just quizzes each covering content from one chapter of the textbook.

Some of the concepts repeat throughout the course, so once you get a feel of it, you'll be fine.","I found the online for this course to be fantastic personally. The EDx is clearly organized, and the content isn't too difficult, but provides a challenge. Can't speak to the in-person, but would definitely recommend the online. Beware though as this course is time consuming because of the amount of problems and assignments and shouldn't be mixed with a term that is already fairly difficult.",all online quizzes and 4% research participation bonus. heads up to SE kids this can count towards your science elective requirements
14,4051,Kimberly Smith,40,28,58,86,69,90,83,56,84,8,"I showed up to class, took good notes and was able to do really well in the course. If you pay attention and do the readings you'll do great. There was a paper, a midterm and a final exam.","This was joint taught by a bunch of profs in the Winter term and I think it was one of the most organized online courses I took. The content modules were all written but there was a bunch of integrated questions to check your understanding. The course is really centered on your ability to reach out for help when you need it since everything was asynchronous. I think my favourite part was how office hours were 1-on-1 and there were a lot of times available throughout the day. The only thing is that some of the nicer TAs had really long wait times lol. Overall super enjoyable though, just make sure to base your design recipe on their given examples or you will lose many marks","(Took online) 100% of our grade was made up of weekly quizzes that were pretty straightforward if you had done the readings. We even got a 4% SONA bonus on top of that, so if you find the topic interesting its easy to do really well. Had Fugelsang and Stolz"

16,4097,Anthony Elliott,40,79,40,90,42,86,69,65,85,8,"This is an easy course with two quizzes, a position paper, and small weekly tutorial assignments (online). I didn't find it that useful because everything is pretty much all common sense and overlapped with other courses.","It's the worst course ever, online especially. They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take this course online.","I took the online course in spring 2021. Fairly light, one quiz a week with the lowest two dropped. The readings can be long but the lecture material is pretty short, both are tested on weekly quizzes. You can get a 4% mark boost with SONA credits so I would recommend doing that."
17,4098,Steven Long,98,21,40,89,26,87,88,97,93,1,Information is general and generic. It's a good filler course- just make sure not to forget to hand in tutorials or hand in things late. As long as you hand it in and it fits the criteria expect a high grade. You gotta read the readings cuz some Q's/assignments are specifically from them.,"Nice course that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website. Pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures. So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90+ in this course. If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)","I took the online, fairly easy, just review the readings and lectures before quizzes and you can achieve an easy 80, and 90 if you put in a good effort. fairly light as well"
18,4114,Sherry Richard,89,22,53,71,53,97,65,54,86,9,"This course was unbearably easy. Most of the content is common sense. However, make sure you do the readings because there are questions that specifically correlate to them.","It was okay. All I can say is, do your work and submit assessments on time. Please don't procrastinate. That's what I did, and I live to regret it. This is because figuring out the solutions to each assessment problem takes time, and procrastinating doesn't help. So, submit early. Submit often. Submit. Submit.","Great course, interesting content. Pretty easy."
19,4123,Mary Davis,45,33,58,79,46,86,67,63,85,8,"This course is really boring in the sense that it is all common sense. There is not necessarily anything new that you will learn. However, one good thing is that there is tons of opportunity to be able to improve your grade (this is from a fall 2020, online perspective). The TAs are super kind and Wade, the instructor, will try his best to be flexible (ex: extending deadlines for assignments).","The end of the course became quite tough but otherwise this was pretty manageable. Excellent professors and ISA's who always take our feedback and concerns into consideration to make the course experience better, including having office hours very late at night and very early in the morning. The online platform is also excellent and fun to use.",Go to class before the first test so that you can get a sense of what the prof is like. Then you can skip all other lectures except the days that have tests. Read the textbook and it's an easy 75-80.

Reviews before COVID was mostly positive. But after COVID-19, a lot of them are negative. I think that reflects something. Assignment were thrown into your face like you just have one class for the whole term. For me, I believe the material we learn and the assignment we need to do is inconsistent in terms of difficulty level. The gap between them is just huge. It often took me eight to twelve hours to finish the assignment. Don't take this if you are doing online.","This course really requires you to sit down with the material and go over it a few times before it starts to make sense. It's a dense one, and I think it's because cognitive science in general is pretty complicated."

The lectures were directly off of the readings.",so difficult for beginners,"This course was super easy, very simple concepts and not many overall. No final exam, just 4 noncumulative tests ~ every 2 weeks. Also had an opportunity to earn 4 bonus marks by participating in 4 credits worth of SONA studies.

22,4143,Joseph Maldonado,74,41,71,97,41,90,69,65,88,2,Fun course to learn but not very useful,"Not an ""EASY"" course at all. Anyone commentating that is probably a Math/Eng student who is already familiar with coding through other courses. Since the midterm/exam is on paper, you have to be able to imagine what your code is going to be able to do without actually testing it like you do in your assignments! Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future. DR. Racket is not even applicable to most organizations. If you want to learn coding, just pick up something off Amazon or get a pdf through a friend - don't spend money here unless you're actually planning on continuing studies in CS.","I'd recommend doing the readings, and studying pretty hard for the exams.

Look over the readings and get the main gist of it tho cuz they're kinda asked on the midterms. TA's for this course are probably the nicest you'll ever meet and will provide extra help or look over you papers for pointers and corrections. They're probably the best part of this course.",Pretty easy course overall! I stopped going to labs about three weeks in and still managed to get the bonus 3%. The assignments were relatively easy (with one or two exceptions).,"Took it online during my co-op term, it wasn't particularly hard or easy.

The mandatory attendance is a garbage rule, if you lose marks for not going that's one thing, but failing the whole component if you miss 2 is absurd. If you get a good TA though it's not terrible, mine let us skip the dumb assignments which was helpful, though I know some TAs made their class stay the whole 90 minutes even if there was nothing left to do.",Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments.,"The course was exactly what I was looking for - easy enough to understand as a non-psych student, but complex and engaging enough to be able to apply concepts. I seriously recommend the course to those interested in programming and machine learning. There are a lot of parallels being drawn between computers and the human brain, and a lot of emphasis on how cognitive science evolves as an applicable research field."

Tutorial was way more beneficial than the actual course content. Dr. Wilson was passionate about the class, but read from the slides directly (which were from the readings directly) which made going to class feel tedious.","Reviewing as a science major, this course was definitely the one that set me up with programming. Even though it was Dr. Racket, concepts were easy to follow. Be sure to go ask a lot of questions if you do not understand.","The course is basically the same as PSYCH101 but with a little more content relating to the brain.

I truly did. But it's dry to an extent I haven't yet experienced in a psych course. The prof I had was probably a huge part of this, but the content really isn't much better. It's rote memorization of experiments that have little to no impact in the real world, or not one that was made clear at any rate. The textbook is written by the professor so you can bet on every lecture being a word for word reading of it.

The exam is really easy but unclear in terms of formatting, etc.","This course is very useful for learning about a broad range of topics in AI. Assignments mainly focus on more specific algorithmic applications in Bayesian networks and Bayesian learning, while lectures also contain some introduction theory to neural networks and gradient descent. If you are new to AI, and you're interested in learning the high-level parts of it, I highly recommend this course!","Boring as hell. Lectures were 3 hours a week. 1 group project with oral presentation worth 30%, 2 essays, one worth 5% another worth 10% Final and midterm were brutal. I barely studied and got an 80. Was just hard for me but class told you everything, no text required to pass."
88,4417,Christopher Moore,46,49,57,84,63,98,72,63,81,9,Thought I really enjoyed the class until I realized he is an extremely hard marker with ridiculous rules for the essay and exams that its impossible to do well. As an 80's student who passed the exam by 3% I would not recommend this class to anyone now. I fully regret taking it and if it wasnt so late in the semester I would have dropped it.,"Covers a broad range of topics all somewhat relating to AI. Topics are not really related to one another, which can be good if you fall behind, but also felt not super cohesive as a course.","This course gets you to actually think about social interactions and why we do the things we do in social interaction. The most relevant parts of the course are those of Altruism and Aggression, because they will really help you understand why you believe in your core values so strongly."
89,4426,Hannah Shaw,85,47,51,70,64,86,64,65,82,8,"Don't take this course with Rowland K Robinson, literally the worst instructor you will ever get, pushes everything to TA, has no clear instruction, doesn't tell you where marks was deducted, I have no idea how to improve on the next assignment. TA is really bad as well, feels like she doesn't even read your paper.","Alice is amazing, lecture quizzes give the motivation to stay on track and lectures are extremely easy to follow and learn from (she explains everything and provides optional deeper explanations). Quizzes are fair and challenging. Assignments and project take a long time but are rewarding. Piazza is super active and she posts weekly check-ups and concise information about current assignments/project deliverables/quizzes due. (Took online in Fall 2020)","I really enjoyed the class. Dr. Megan McCarthy had three noncumulative midterms, and a straightforward reflection paper. She also gave us the option to write any of the multiple-choice questions as short-answer in case we had trouble distinguishing between two multiple-choice options. Really interactive lectures, which was appreciated."
90,4428,Kristi York,69,73,76,78,40,84,73,74,90,1,"I took this course online with Dr. Rashmee Singh in Winter 2021. We had 3 discussion exercises worth 10% each, a take-home midterm worth 35%, and an applied term paper worth 35%. Dr. Singh uploaded video recordings + powerpoint slides of the lectures every week and we had assigned readings every week. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. The course content was interesting throughout. My only complaint is that the marking for the midterm and paper was quite hard and strict. I wish we were given rubrics beforehand so we knew exactly what was being expected of us.","Good course, lots of breadth in AI, not much depth. Assignments take a long time, project is also time-consuming.",Very interesting class. Some can be repetitive from psych 101 but still good information to know.
91,4431,Adam Anderson,87,43,45,94,52,88,85,90,86,3,"Do your readings, take this course after you completed PSYCH 391/advanced data analysis, it will be a lot easier",Can get very busy at times but provides a fairly good overview of AI systems.,"Some overlap regarding PSYCH101R material. Course consisted of 3 non cumulative tests, a reflection paper, and SONA Research experience. Textbook material is important as is makes up majority of tests."
92,4432,Holly Brooks,52,21,67,77,24,91,84,60,93,9,Very good class! Do well in the class reflection paper and the two midterms!,"Easily the best, most well-written course I've taken at university.","If you are looking for a psych course, this isn't where to go. A lot of the content was philosophy, linguistics, with a sprinkle of neuroscience. Also the readings are really difficult to digest. 10/10 would not recommend. If this course is required for you, may the force be with you."
93,4434,Dana Carroll,97,47,75,72,30,87,77,84,87,2,Engaging interesting and supportive professors and TAs. Many different ways to be successful in this class and the content was super interesting and developed more simple concepts learned in 1st/2nd year into much more complex ideas.,Assignments are simple but require a lot of time.,Don't take this course if you were hoping for psychology or neuroscience.. it's all philosophy. Took it online and the profs are such hard markers and don't give any feedback on assignments. Readings are difficult to understand unless maybe you are a philosophy major. Exam was 9-15 written pages essay format with no indication on what it could possibly be on .
94,4436,Christina Brooks,46,77,79,70,17,94,84,78,87,1,"Would recommend for anyone who is interested in sociology/needs to take an elective. Can survive the course without the textbook, just really focus on the key concepts and terms outlined in class.","Hardest fucking course ever, rating is more like 10%, don't take.","The professors felt detached and difficult to approach. Be careful about outside sources, because this class only wants you to use the material they provide for your essays. Needless to say, just being able to pass will be plenty good, it can be difficult if you don't keep up with the readings."
95,4443,Shannon Estrada,65,68,39,74,33,87,83,77,91,7,"This had the potential to be a really interesting course, but unfortunately Prof. Nelson doesn't present the information in a compelling way. She's a kind person, but she focuses on insignificant statistics rather than actual relevant concepts.","Covers a lot of topics in AI, enough to get a good overall sense of the subject, but with so much covered, depth is lacking a bit.","An interesting course. The material touches upon computer science concepts, so it would be helpful to have some background CS knowledge. The workload is relatively light with two essays, a midterm and a final."
96,4463,Cassie Lawson,72,77,47,78,52,86,84,67,84,1,Somewhat interesting content. Too theoretical to be applicable.,"This course gave an overview of AI and ML. I took with Pascal, and his assignments were mostly programming questions and were super fun. His midterm and final exams are not bad, if you study the slides well. Since it's a 4th year course, you are expected to learn new things quickly e.g Python and ML libraries (they will not be covered in lectures). You will have about 2 weeks for each assignment, so it should be fine.","Useful in the sense that you learn about how neuroscience and computer science can converge, but you will gain more out of this class after taking upper year psych/neuro or CS classes. The readings can be a little tricky if it involves content outside of your field - it's very abstract. You can access the books when you search online via the UW library website (make sure you're logged in) so there's no need to buy it."
97,4478,Alicia Wood,66,32,43,89,61,99,67,79,85,3,"I found the course to cover the basic information and theories discussed in the textbook. I do believe it would have been more beneficial if we were able to discuss theories more in-depth, to gain a better grasp of the material, but there was so much information to cover that there wasn't enough allotted time for class discussion. The course was pretty cut and dry: theories and real-life examples of such. The topics were interesting but what added to the interest of the topic was an engaging professor.","Very high-level overview, you don't really learn any details though, so it's not super useful...","Introduces various topics of cognitive science (with a strong emphasis on philosophy, I felt). Tests and one essay. No final. About 20 questions covering two books are given before the tests. Personally did not enjoy the course material, though those interested may like this course."
98,4490,Douglas Faulkner,79,45,45,77,71,93,73,83,84,1,"The content was generally pretty interesting and I think it would be even better if you're into sports. Midterms were really easy and some of them were the questions given to you in in-class assignments or just straight from the slides. Although I did not know anything about sports beforehand, it was still an interesting class!","The topics were interesting but I think they were very outdated. Large portion of the course was spent on traditional AI techniques such as A* search algorithm, constraint satisfaction, and rational reasoning, which aren't very useful. There was little focus on machine learning. The assignments were also not very useful, but they could depend on the the term. It does give an overview of AI so it's worth taking",Take it. Read the articles. Reference all those articles in your different essays. It's a great online course that's not too heavy.
99,4493,Charles Hicks,41,61,56,80,57,92,89,78,84,1,"I enjoyed this course very much. Teaches you all about the aging population and what factors affect their lives. The course was comprised of eight weekly quizzes based off the material in the textbook, one midterm, one research report and a final. Not too difficult of a course however I wouldn't consider it a bird. Just go to class, pay attention, read the textbook and you will do fine.","AI is more of an umbrella term for a large number of problem solving and machine learning methodologies such as A* search and neural networks. Unfortunately, this course only touches the surface of most of those topics. On the bright side, the final was rather easy.","not a good course to take online; also content is very much philosophically grounded. if you're looking for a technical intro to fields related to cognitive science, this is unfortunately not where to find that"
